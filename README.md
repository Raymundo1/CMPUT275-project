How to play 2048:
  * The objective of the game is to get the number "2048" using additions of the number two and its multiples.
  * You will have a grid of 16 or 36 tiles. Two numbers will be given: usually two number twos, maybe number four.
  * Move uo or down, left or right trying to join two equal numbers.
  * When two equal numbers are in touch, they will add up.
  * If there are no free tiles on our grid, the game ends.
  * By adding numbers, we get higher numbers and we can approach to 2048, which is the goal of the game.
